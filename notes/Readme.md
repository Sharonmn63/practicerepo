# A folder for notes

Try to practice syncing your version of the practice repo with this version, and then add a new markdown file with your notes from class on the 29th.

For more info on markdown syntax, see [daring fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

There are many people out there using markdown for the research writing and notetaking. Just google 'markdown for academic' or 'markdown humanities'.
